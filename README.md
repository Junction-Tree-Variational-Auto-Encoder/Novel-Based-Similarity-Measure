# Novel Based Similarity Measure based on the Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Graph Generation

In this repository we explore the similarity measurement of the newly generated molecules. 
Use Tutorial_sim.ipynb to see main results of the project. We emphasize, that it can be computationally heavy.

Implementation of the Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04364](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04364)

To install the environment correctly with all packages, see the link below and complete the same installments. 
We recommend that you install a new environment with the rdkit package as a base.
